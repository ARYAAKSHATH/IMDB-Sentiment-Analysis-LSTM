# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM
End To End Computer Science Project (B198)


A deep learning project that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. This project processes the IMDB dataset (50k reviews) to predict audience sentiment and includes a movie recommendation simulation.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Sentiment Classification:** Binary classification (Positive/Negative) of text data.
* **Deep Learning Architecture:** Utilizes LSTM layers with Dropout for effective sequence learning.
* **Data Visualization:** Insightful plots for sentiment distribution and review lengths.
* **Recommendation Engine:** A simulated business logic to recommend movies based on predicted sentiment scores.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Preprocessing:** Scikit-learn (Train/Test Split)

## 📊 Results
* **Training Accuracy:** ~88%
* **Test Accuracy:** 88%
* **Test Loss:** 0.2884
